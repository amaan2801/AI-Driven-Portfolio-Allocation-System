# AI-Driven Portfolio Allocation System

## Overview

This project presents an AI-driven framework for portfolio allocation that integrates machine learning–based return prediction with portfolio optimization techniques. The system is designed to assist investors and analysts in making informed, data-backed asset allocation decisions while maintaining transparency and risk awareness.
